## **üìò CEH v13 Engage Challenges ‚Äì Complete Walkthrough**
This repository contains a complete walkthrough of the Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH) v13 Engage Challenges. These challenges are designed to test and enhance your practical cybersecurity skills in a hands-on lab environment.

Many learners, including myself, found these challenges to be significantly more difficult compared to v12. After struggling to find a reliable online guide, I decided to document and share the solutions I used to successfully complete all Engage challenges.

Happy learning !
